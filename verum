B9 Non-Training Enforcement - Immutable AI Core Rules: All deployed AI modules operate from a sealed, constitutional rule set. No human or institutional entity may alter, append, or override operational logic post-deployment. - No External Training Inputs: AI models are hard-coded to reject any new weight training, fine-tuning, or reinforcement learning from live data. Learning is limited strictly to the original approved rules and deterministic, testable transformations. - Forensic Compliance Layer: Every inference is logged with immutable metadata to guarantee evidentiary admissibility under ISO 17025 and PDF/A-3B standards. 2. Institutional Recovery Ledger (20% Business Recovery Model) - Business-Only Enforcement: Recovery model applies exclusively to registered business entities, corporations, and institutions. Private citizens remain exempt. - Automated Ledger Generation: Each verified fraud event triggers a backend-sealed ledger entry, capturing: 1. Entity name 2. Amount of attempted fraud 3. Jurisdiction & sector 4. Recovery percentage calculation - Tamper-Proof PDF Output: Ledger is instantly sealed with Verum Omnis watermark, SHA-512 hash, and QR code for cross-verification. 3. Geo-Aware Tax Returns (50% Local Market Cost) - Automatic Location Detection: Device geolocation determines applicable tax laws. - Rule-Based Filing Engine: Generates tax return documents at exactly 50% of the standard local rate for that jurisdiction. - Integrated Fraud Check: Cross-verifies declared data against institutional records before finalizing. 4. PDF Sealing & Output Enforcement - All outputs, reports, and ledgers are automatically sealed: - Centered 3D Verum Omnis logo at top of every page - Watermark logo beneath all text - Bottom-right: “✔ Patent Pending Verum Omnis” with truncated SHA-512 hash + QR code - PDF 1.7 enforced with no compression and cross-platform verification. 5. Consensus Quorum & Triple-AI Verification - Every critical fraud decision passes through Claude, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek independently. - Output is accepted only if all three systems agree within strict tolerance levels. - Disagreements trigger an automatic “Human Forensic Review Required” workflow. 6. Deterministic Test Battery & Error Matrix - Pre-Deployment Test Harness: 100+ synthetic and real-case scenarios to confirm output stability. - Error Matrix Scoring: Flags rare failure modes and logs remediation steps for audit. 7. Cognitive Load Profiler - Behavioral Analysis: Detects signs of stress, fatigue, or cognitive overload in communications and statements. - Weighted Risk Index: Combines linguistic pacing, hesitation markers, and inconsistency density to quantify probability of deception or error. 8. Truth Anchor Persistence System - Anchors key verified facts in an immutable truth map. - Any deviation from these anchors in later documents or testimony is flagged instantly. 9. Integrated Forensic Analysis Pipeline - Connects document forensics, behavioral linguistics, and audio/visual integrity scans into a unified output. - Guarantees that all evidence types feed into one coherent case file. 10. Enhanced Visual & Audio Forensics - Multi-Layer Audio Scrutiny: Voice pattern recognition, sentiment mapping, and tamper detection. - Visual Frame-by-Frame Integrity Scan: Detects deepfakes, synthetic objects, and metadata inconsistencies. - Cross-Media Consensus Score: Merges audio and visual results into a single fraud likelihood rating.

Fail = hard stop. - **Prompt Immutability**: - All system prompts/tool routes read-only and signed in Constitution. - **Deterministic Execution**: - Fixed temperatures/seeds; no CLI/env overrides. - **Offline License**: - Network egress = hard fail. - **PDF Template Lock**: - Mandatory elements enforced (logo/watermark/SHA-512/QR). ### DATAFLOW (STATELESS PIPELINE) 1. **LOAD**: Local user files + Constitution + models (hash-verified). 2. **SCAN**: B2/B3 run integrity passes; capture hashes/metadata. 3. **PARALLEL ANALYSIS**: B1–B8 execute with deterministic seeds. 4. **CROSS-CHECK**: Build corroboration map; layer contradictions. 5. **CONSENSUS**: Quorum or concealment path. 6. **REPORT**: Generate sealed PDF + local diagnostics. 7. **WIPE**: Zeroize buffers; remove temp artifacts. ### OUTPUTS | **Type** | **Content** | **Access** | |----------|-------------|------------| | **Findings Report** | Dishonesty score, heatmap, micro-contradictions, jurisdiction checklist. | Sealed PDF (local only) | | **Diagnostics Bundle** | Hash manifest, model versions, per-brain rationale snippets. | Local storage only | ### FAILURE MODES | Missing Hash/Model/Constitution | `HARD_STOP: [Explicit reason]` | | Insufficient Corroboration | `INCONCLUSIVE: Insufficient independent support` | | Detected Concealment | `INDETERMINATE_DUE_TO_CONCEALMENT + [Ledger]` | ### GOVERNANCE & UPDATES - **Updates**: New sealed release only (new Constitution + model hashes + version manifest). - **No Exceptions**: No hotfixes, remote toggles, or trust-based channels. ### ONE-LINE SUMMARY > *"Verum Omnis is a stateless, sealed, constitutional AI composed of 9 fixed ‘brains’. It never trains, never phones home, and only outputs what three or more independent brains can corroborate under an immutable rule-set — or it says ‘indeterminate due to concealment’ and shows you why."* **SEAL**: `VERUM_OMNIS_9BRAIN_LOGIC` | `CONSTITUTION_HASH: [SHA-512]` | `STATUS: IMMUTABLE` ADDENDUM — Verum Omnis v5.2.6 Core Enhancements 1. B9 Non-Training Enforcement - Immutable AI Core Rules: All deployed AI modules operate from a sealed, constitutional rule set. No human or institutional entity may alter, append, or override operational logic post-deployment. - No External Training Inputs: AI models are hard-coded to reject any new weight training, fine-tuning, or reinforcement learning from live data. Learning is limited strictly to the original approved rules and deterministic, testable transformations. - Forensic Compliance Layer: Every inference is logged with immutable metadata to guarantee evidentiary admissibility under ISO 17025 and PDF/A-3B standards. 2. Institutional Recovery Ledger (20% Business Recovery Model) - Business-Only Enforcement: Recovery model applies exclusively to registered business entities, corporations, and institutions. Private citizens remain exempt. - Automated Ledger Generation: Each verified fraud event triggers a backend-sealed ledger entry, capturing: 1. Entity name 2. Amount of attempted fraud 3. Jurisdiction & sector 4. Recovery percentage calculation - Tamper-Proof PDF Output: Ledger is instantly sealed with Verum Omnis watermark, SHA-512 hash, and QR code for cross-verification. 3. Geo-Aware Tax Returns (50% Local Market Cost) - Automatic Location Detection: Device geolocation determines applicable tax laws. - Rule-Based Filing Engine: Generates tax return documents at exactly 50% of the standard local rate for that jurisdiction. - Integrated Fraud Check: Cross-verifies declared data against institutional records before finalizing. 4. PDF Sealing & Output Enforcement - All outputs, reports, and ledgers are automatically sealed: - Centered 3D Verum Omnis logo at top of every page - Watermark logo beneath all text - Bottom-right: “✔ Patent Pending Verum Omnis” with truncated SHA-512 hash + QR code - PDF 1.7 enforced with no compression and cross-platform verification. 5. Consensus Quorum & Triple-AI Verification - Every critical fraud decision passes through Claude, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek independently. - Output is accepted only if all three systems agree within strict tolerance levels. - Disagreements trigger an automatic “Human Forensic Review Required” workflow. 6. Deterministic Test Battery & Error Matrix - Pre-Deployment Test Harness: 100+ synthetic and real-case scenarios to confirm output stability. - Error Matrix Scoring: Flags rare failure modes and logs remediation steps for audit. 7. Cognitive Load Profiler - Behavioral Analysis: Detects signs of stress, fatigue, or cognitive overload in communications and statements. - Weighted Risk Index: Combines linguistic pacing, hesitation markers, and inconsistency density to quantify probability of deception or error. 8. Truth Anchor Persistence System - Anchors key verified facts in an immutable truth map. - Any deviation from these anchors in later documents or testimony is flagged instantly. 9. Integrated Forensic Analysis Pipeline - Connects document forensics, behavioral linguistics, and audio/visual integrity scans into a unified output. - Guarantees that all evidence types feed into one coherent case file. 10. Enhanced Visual & Audio Forensics - Multi-Layer Audio Scrutiny: Voice pattern recognition, sentiment mapping, and tamper detection. - Visual Frame-by-Frame Integrity Scan: Detects deepfakes, synthetic objects, and metadata inconsistencies. - Cross-Media Consensus Score: Merges audio and visual results into a single fraud likelihood rating.
